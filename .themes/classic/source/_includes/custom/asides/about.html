  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <p>Ahoy smallfry! My name is Wesley Carr. I'm a 20 year-old Delaware native spending the summer at General Assembly in NYC. The reason: Web Development. I hope to display new techniques learned, struggles overcome and solutions found on this octo-blog. Other than that, I'll post a fair amount of things I personally find exciting or entertaining. Thanks for routing by!!
