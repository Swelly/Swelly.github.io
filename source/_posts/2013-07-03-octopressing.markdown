After a couple (meaning 3) tries to launch my Octopress blog, I've risen, triumphant. The first tasks I've set for myself regarding this blog, is to add my own interface options instead of using the default theme. I feel comfortable enough with basic CSS elements to use an alternative template and then tweak / prune the style to something similar of my own.

But with all the work and new techniques we learn in class I'm sure (if I manage my time well enough) I'll be able to fully customize and optimize what comes through my blog posts as well as how it's received, visually.
