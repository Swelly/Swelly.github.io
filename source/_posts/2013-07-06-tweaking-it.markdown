Not a long post here, but I wanted to note my progress on the layout & customization of this here Octopress dubbed: **Web Fu**. Obviously the title has changed (previously the captivating "*My Octopress Blog"*), but I've imported Google Fonts as well to add some custom spice to my life. Honestly though, as if the people at Gizoogle didn't impress me enough... their font-directory over at <a href = "https://www.google.com/fonts"> Google Fonts </a> is ridiculously good-looking.

##### A quick note and +1 to Google is their release of [Google Flights](http://www.google.com/flights). It rivals the international app [Skyscanner](http://Skyscanner.net) and provides a clean interface when selecting cheaper air-fare. It looks as though Google's acquisition of ITASoftware back in 2010 has finally paid off. Here's a link to the Matrix database ITA created [http://matrix.itasoftware.com](http://http://matrix.itasoftware.com)

Anyways, I'm looking to style this theme a bit more before next week once my class dives into the Rails framework. So in the meantime, I'm going to browse through some themes and of courseâ€¦ stay on the path towards enightenment with Ruby Koans
